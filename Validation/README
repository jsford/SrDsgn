This folder contains a verifiable implementation of the shell and filament
methods for calculating the force between a coil and a cylindrical magnet.
These methods are described (with a couple typos) in ../docs/magcyl.pdf
The following files are included here:

    validation.py  - A python script that sets up the conditions required to
                     duplicate Fig. 4 in magcyl.pdf and produces the graph in 
                     validation.pdf
                     RUN: ipython validation.py

    actuator.py    - The class definitions for Magnet, Coil, and Actuator. 
                     Defines the shell and filament methods.
    
    Validation.pdf - A matplotlib graph comparing the filament and
                     shell methods. It should duplicate Fig. 4 from magcyl.pdf
    
    Validation.ods - An Excel spreadsheet with pretty much the same information
                     as Validation.pdf
